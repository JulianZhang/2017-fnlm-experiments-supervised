"""
    Extracts signatures from a given log file using a neural model to tag the fixed and variable part

    Uses a heuristic to correct tags. Splits the annotated lines into words, and checks if some of the tags can be corrected_sal

    For example, a "VFV" tag for "999" can be most likely corrected to VVV.
